## What RGB is?

**Smart contracts** layer on top of **Bitcoin** & **Lightning Network**, with emphasize on privacy and scalability.

*Digital right ownership managment system, confidental & censorship-resistant built on/for BTC & LN Network.*

- Right ownership is assigned to Bitcoin transactions outputs
- Meaning that it is managed by Bitcoin transaction validation rules (Bitcoin script)
- Details on rights and additional limints on rights management are managet by [client-validated data](https://github.com/LNP-BP/client_side_validation/)

**BLUE** part: sigchain address

**RED** part: rmd160hash of a transaction

**GREEN** part: is a signature
